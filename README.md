## Set Up Backend Server ##
Either run the Java backend by using your IDE or by typing 

```
mvn exec:exec
```
in the back-end folder. This will start the Java server at http://localhost:8080.

## Set Up Frontend Server ##
In the front-end folder, run

```
npm install
npm start
```

This will start the front-end server at http://localhost:3000. You can update the front-end code as the server is running in the development mode (i.e., npm start). It will automatically recompile and reload.
